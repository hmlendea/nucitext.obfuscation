## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers have had an opportunity to validate and remediate them.

To report a vulnerability:
- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/hmlendea/nucitext.obfuscation/security/advisories)
- Contact the maintainers directly

## 📌 Scope

The original maintainers are not responsible for changes, modifications, or security issues introduced by downstream forks.

The subsequent report categories are in scope for this repository:
- Vulnerabilities in the NuciText.Obfuscation library code
- Vulnerabilities in the public API surface (Obfuscate, Deobfuscate methods)
- Vulnerabilities in the NuciTextObfuscatorOptions configuration

The subsequent categories are out of scope unless explicitly stated to the contrary:
- Issues in downstream forks or modified distributions
- Misuse of the library contrary to documented usage
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies not directly maintained by this project

## 📢 Disclosure Policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure:
1. Vulnerabilities are investigated privately.
2. A remediation plan is prepared and validated.
3. Public disclosure is published after a fix, mitigation, or agreed risk decision is available.
4. Credit is attributed in accordance with reporter preference and project policy.
